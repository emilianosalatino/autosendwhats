# This is Version 2...
# Sending whatsapp text messages without closing and opening windows. It can use emojis in VS Code
# It works by using keyboard shortcuts. 
# I added a number validation. IF a number is not found, or it isn't a whatsapp number, it now escapes a couple times and goes to a new chat box and also writes errors into variable and prints them out in console.
# This script requires the pyperclip and pyautogui libraries.
# Make sure you have WhatsApp Web open and logged in before running the script.
