# Auto Send for WP.
A simple Python Script to send texts via WhatsApp automatically.

It is SLOW... first of all... like 5 messages a minute.

Basically it emulates keyboard shortcuts. 

IF a number is not found, it now verifies, and logs the number in a list, and hops to next number. It prints the list out at the end. 

It is written for Python 3.9.7, and easiest to use with Visual Studio Code.

Check Dependencies.

One you run it, there's a 5 second gap for you to click on the whatsapp window and it works from there. 

WORKS IN EDGE BROWSER, SHOULD WORK IN OTHERS
