# Auto Send for WP.
A simple Python Script to send texts via WhatsApp automatically. 

I made it because everything else is too complex, or dependency heavy... I just needed to send texts. Also, this doesn't mess with opening and closing browser tabs as WP Web is suuuper slow when loading in new tabs or windows. 

It is **SLOW**... first of all... like 5 messages a minute. The sleep times are there for whatsapp web to load data. 

Basically it emulates keyboard shortcuts. 

IF a number is not found, it now verifies, and logs the number in a list, and hops to next number. It prints the list out at the end. 

It is written for Python 3.9.7, and easiest to use with Visual Studio Code.

Check Dependencies. You **MUST** be logged into your whatsapp already in Edge. One you run it in say VS Code, there's a 5 second gap for you to click on the browser's  whatsapp window and it works from there. 

WORKS IN EDGE BROWSER, SHOULD WORK IN OTHERS
