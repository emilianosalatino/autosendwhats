# Auto Send for WP.

A simple Python Script to send texts via WhatsApp automatically.

It is SLOW... first of all... like 5 messages a minute.

Basically it emulates keyboard shortcuts. 

IF a number is not found, it screws everything up.. hopefully i can write an error catcher later.

If the phone number is not correct or not found, you must change window to your console and hit ctrl+c to stop the program, delete number from the list and restart.

It is written for Python 3.9.7, and easiest to use with Visual Studio Code.

One you run it, there's a 5 second gap for you to click on the whatsapp window and it works from there.
